# Project: Employee Data Pre-processing for Analysis
 Objective: To consolidate and prepare employee data from multiple Excel files for analysis in Tableau.
## Process:
 * Data Acquisition:
   * Downloaded three Excel files from Tableau Public:
     * "Employee names"
     * "Employee data"
     * "Employee travel responses"
 * Data Preprocessing:
   * Utilized data preprocessing techniques to:
     * Clean and standardize data within each Excel file.
     * Merge or join the data from the three Excel files based on common identifiers (e.g., employee IDs).
     * Transform data into a suitable format for Tableau analysis.
     * Handle any inconsistant data.
     * Create any calculated fields, if needed.
     * Utilize concepts like joins, unions and relationships to combine multiple data sources into one single source for enhanced analysis.
 * Data Consolidation:
   * Created a single, consolidated dataset containing:
     * Employee IDs
     * Employee names
     * Hire dates
     * Country
     * State
     * Zip Code
     * Other relevant employee information.
 * Data Output:
   * Saved the processed and consolidated dataset in a format compatible with Tableau. 
 * Data Storage:
   * The original source files and the resulting processed data have been attached.
## Key Data Elements:
* Employee IDs
* Country
